# An android App for Tracking a personal Health History
When having certain health issues, finding the diagnosis can be difficult. Especially when symptoms come over weeks or month, it makes sense to track every possible hint. TrackIt is a simple Tracking App focusing on making tracking of health related events as less anoying as possible.
